# DealOrNoDeal


## Objective:
The objective of the game is to select briefcases containing higher cash amounts and negotiate with the "banker" to get the best possible deal for the briefcase the player holds.

## Setup:

1. The game has 10 briefcases, each containing a different cash amount: $1, $5, $10, $100, $1000, $5000, $10000, $100000, $500000, $1000000000.
2. At the beginning of the game, all briefcases are closed, and their contents are unknown.

## Gameplay: 

1. The player starts by selecting 3 briefcases from the set of closed briefcases. 
2. After selecting the briefcases, the player will reveal the cash amounts inside the chosen briefcases.
3. The revealed cash amounts are removed from the pool of possible winnings.
4. At this point, the "banker" will make an offer to the player based on the remaining cash amounts. 
The banker will offer an amount as low as possible but high enough for the player to accept the deal.
5. The player has two options:
   a. "Deal" - Accept the banker's offer and end the game. The player wins the offered amount.
   b. "No Deal" - Reject the banker's offer and continue to the next round.

   If the player chooses "No Deal," they must select another set of 3 briefcases and repeat the process.

## Final Round: 

1. In the final round, when only 3 briefcases are left, there will be no more deals with the banker.
2. The player must select one of the remaining 3 briefcases.
3. The amount in the chosen briefcase is the player's final winning amount.
